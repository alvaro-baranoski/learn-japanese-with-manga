MAIN PROBLEM
I like to read Yuragi-Sou no Yuuna-San, but all translated version are not from the original art. So I would like to automatically translate the original source and read it that way. I am also learning japanese, so it would be nice to switch between languages and see the meaning and translation of japanese characters.

BONUS
- I would like to read manga on my phone
- I would like to get automatic updates and translations of new chapters (those whose art are different between the official and the translated)
